UNCC SI Project in ITIS6177

Hi
  I am Jack, I have a idea now. Could we make a website about crowdfunding in UNCC? As we know, money is necessary for technological innovations. But it will be very hard to find a investment company to get some help. Many a good idea may get lost. So I want to make a website to solve this problem. (https://www.kickstarter.com/learn?ref=hero This is a crowdfunding website.)We can make a "small" one for UNCC students. People who have good ideas can release their products or ideas to our website and others who are interested in them can donate to them. 
  
  How do you think about it? Give me some advice or a better idea. 
  By the way, I haven't used C# before, could anyone who has work experience or C# experience to create a Visual Studio Online account(Joe sent you a e-mail.)?
  
  Thanks.
  Qing Guo.
